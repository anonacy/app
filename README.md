## @anonacy/app

***

### About
This app is for managing email alias identities with the v2 @anonacy/api. It allows you to view, edit, create, and delete aliases, domains, endpoints & more.

![app demo](docs/aliases.png)

A commercial version hosted by us is found at [app.anonacy.com](https://app.anonacy.com)

### Authorization
As of now, the app uses simple api key authorization. It is available for organizations who need their own aliasing mail server. The api key is automatically scoped to the org & server it is assigned to.

User based authentication will come soon, enabling external users to manage aliases within a server. (Similar to v1 anonacy)

### Access
If you are an organization that would like to run their own aliasing server, please make a request to [support@anonacy.com](mailto:support@anonacy.com) and we can issue an api key depending on the use case.

### Documentation

This app is a lightweight UI for the @anonacy/api. Full api documentation can be found here:
